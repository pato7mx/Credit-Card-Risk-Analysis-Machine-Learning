# Data-Analytics-Bootcamp-Final-Project

## First Segment

### Selected Topic
" Credit Card approval prediction"

### Reason why we selected the topic
The dataset we found is ideal to test the exact knowledge we acquired through the Bootcamp. Also using data to define if a client geta a credit card is a common practice in the financial industry today. This way we can test our knowledge in a realistic environment.


### Description of the source of the data
We got our data from a Data Science community website named Kaggle. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

### Question we are going to answer with the data
Does the user will be able to get a credit card approval based on data?
